# NekoPresenceStruct
 A small wrapper for <a href="https://github.com/nkrapivin/NekoPresence">nkrapivin's NekoPresence</a> that lets you treat the system as a struct
 <hr>
 <p>
 To use it, simply assing a NPStruct to a variable <code>myRCP = NPStruct([application id])</code> and it will now have access to everything needed for your Discord RCP.
 <br>Remember to run <code>myRCP.update()</code> to make it appear on profiles.<br><br>
 Changing data is as simple as doing <code>myRCP.ImageLarge.Text = "Image text"</code>
